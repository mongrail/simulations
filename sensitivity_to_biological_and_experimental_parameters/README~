INTRODUCTION

Each png file in this folder shows the Reciever Operator Characteristics (ROC) curves for Mongrail (red line) and NewHybrids (blue line). Each plot is based on 10,000 individuals for a particular set of simulation combination. The top row uses a smaller region (R=1cM) with a lower number of expected recombinations and the bottom row uses a larger region (R=50cM) with a higher number of expected recombinations. Results for the six genealogical classes (\textbf{a}-\textbf{f}) are shown from left to right in both rows.

FILENAME CONVENTION

The filename for each png files implies the simulation combination used to generate the figure. The parameters (factors) and their values were as follows:

1. Number of chromosomes (K):	K = {1, 2, 5, 10, 20}
2. Number of loci per chromosome (L):	L = {1, 5, 10}
3. Expected recombination frequency (R) measured in cM:	R = {1, 25, 50} between the first and the last locus
4. Number of distinct haplotype sequences per chromosome for each population (h): h = {5, 10, 15}
5. Allelic configurations of haplotypes, generated by simulating the switches between allele states (see description below). Switch rates used (c): c = {0.1, 1, L/2}
6. Haplotype frequencies, following a Dirichlet distribution (symmetrical with parameters alpha = {1,5}, or non-symmetrical with parameters {w = 5, 20})

In each plot we are only interested in comparing the two competing methods (Mongrail and NewHybrids) under R=1cM (top row) and R=50cM (bottom row). Therefore each plot is based on a particular simulation combination of five parameters. We implemented the following convention in naming the png file for the five parameters:

K{}_L{}_h{}_c{}_alpha{}.png or, K{}_L{}_h{}_c{}_w{}.png depending upon whether the haplotype frequencies follow symmetric or non-symmetric distribution respectively. The empty braces {} corresponding to each parameter indicates the value it takes.
For example, a png filename "K20_L5_h5_c0.1_w5.png" will signify that the simulation parameters K = 20, L = 5, h = 5, c = 0.1, w = 5 were used to generate this figure.

NOTE: When the parameter switch rate (c) takes the value L/2, the empty braces {} corresponding to c will be 0.5L in the png filename.
