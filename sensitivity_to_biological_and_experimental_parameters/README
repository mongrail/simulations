INTRODUCTION

Each png file in this folder shows proportion of simulated individuals with posterior probabilities for the correct genealogical class greater than 0.9 (y-axis) versus the number of chromosomes sampled per individual (x-axis). Each plot is based on 10,000 individuals for a particular set of simulation combination. Different colored curves are plotted for 6 different combinations of numbers of loci and expected recombination rates (in cM). The results for Mongrail are shown in the top row and for NewHybrids in the bottom row. Results for the 6 genealogical classes that individuals were simulated under are given from left to right in each row.

FILENAME CONVENTION

The filename for each png files implies the simulation combination used to generate the figure. The parameters (factors) and their values were as follows:

1. Number of chromosomes (K):	K = {1, 2, 5, 10, 20}
2. Number of loci per chromosome (L):	L = {1, 5, 10}
3. Expected recombination frequency (R) measured in cM:	R = {1, 25, 50} between the first and the last locus
4. Number of distinct haplotype sequences per chromosome for each population (h): h = {5, 10, 15}
5. Allelic configurations of haplotypes, generated by simulating the switches between allele states (see description below). Switch rates used (c): c = {0.1, 1, L/2}
6. Haplotype frequencies, following a Dirichlet distribution (symmetrical with parameters alpha = {1,5}, or non-symmetrical with parameters {w = 5, 20})

Here in each plot we examine the relative influence of 3 parameters: K, L, and R on the power of the methods to identify genealogical classes (using a posterior probability of 0.9 as a threshold for classifying individuals) while other parameters (h,c, alpha/w) were held constant. Therefore each plot is based on a particular simulation combination of three parameters. We implemented the following convention in naming the png file for the three parameters:

h{}_c{}_alpha{}.png or, h{}_c{}_w{}.png depending upon whether the haplotype frequencies follow symmetric or non-symmetric distribution respectively. The empty braces {} corresponding to each parameter indicates the value it takes.
For example, a png filename "h5_c0.1_w20.png" will signify that the simulation parameters h = 5, c = 0.1, w = 20 were used to generate this figure.

NOTE: When the parameter switch rate (c) takes the value L/2, the empty braces {} corresponding to c will be 0.5L in the png filename.
