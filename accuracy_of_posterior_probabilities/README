INTRODUCTION

Each png file in this folder shows the distributions of posterior probabilities for random subsets of 100 individuals simulated under each of the 6 genealogical classes (plots labelled a-f) for a particular set of simulation combination. Posterior probabilities for Mongrail are shown in the top plot and for NewHybrids in the bottom plot. The posterior probabilities for different genealogical classes are represented by segments of different colors. The proportion of the stacked bar plot comprised of a particular color indicates the posterior probability of the model corresponding to that color.

FILENAME CONVENTION

The filename for each png files implies the simulation combination used to generate the figure. The parameters (factors) and their values were as follows:

1. Number of chromosomes (K):	K = {1, 2, 5, 10, 20}
2. Number of loci per chromosome (L):	L = {1, 5, 10}
3. Expected recombination frequency (R) measured in cM:	R = {1, 25, 50} between the first and the last locus
4. Number of distinct haplotype sequences per chromosome for each population (h): h = {5, 10, 15}
5. Allelic configurations of haplotypes, generated by simulating the switches between allele states (see description below). Switch rates used (c): c = {0.1, 1, L/2}
6. Haplotype frequencies, following a Dirichlet distribution (symmetrical with parameters alpha = {1,5}, or non-symmetrical with parameters {w = 5, 20})

We implemented the following convention in naming the png file for the six parameters:

K{}_L{}_R{}_h{}_c{}_alpha{}.png or, K{}_L{}_R{}_h{}_c{}_w{}.png depending upon whether the haplotype frequencies follow symmetric or non-symmetric distribution respectively. The empty braces {} corresponding to each parameter indicates the value it takes.
For example, a png filename "K20_L10_R50_h5_c0.1_alpha1.png" will signify that the simulation parameters K = 20, L = 10, R = 50, h = 5, c = 0.1, alpha = 1 were used to generate this figure.

NOTE: When the parameter switch rate (c) takes the value L/2, the empty braces {} corresponding to c will be 0.5L in the png filename.
